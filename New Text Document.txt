1- User can signup/login
2- user will create events by providing details that are in evetns table including URL.
3- When user create event he can add friends, when user add friends they will be stored
in the form of json ojbect array which will has the properties eg. {userID, accept/decline} these are for
to track which friends are invited and are they accept or decline the events.
4- every event will have the property "createBy" which represent the owner of the event
5- When user is creating events and selecting users for inviting them, then he can check whether they are busy or not
because of events table we can check this by getting all events members and events timings,
for example if I'm creating event and I have select user2 to invite him then we will get all evetns and we will
search for events which has user2 and for example if user2 is in two evetns then we will get day/timing of that two events
and we will compare there timing with the timing of new evetns. this is how we can check whether the users are busy or available.
6- If users are avaliable we will create event and add the infor about event and its member in the events table and we willl sent the invitiations to
all users invited by the creator/owner of the event.
7- The users who are invited by the owner of the event, can accept or decline the event if they decline then the propert of invitaion accept/decilne will be updated,
If they accept then the event will be created in their calendar.


when you add me, and select date and time, and do a search
In this case, it will take the date and time for 3 months from my events list and check if I am free or not
And this way you can see if I am free or not
